**Host**: An entity capable of network communication (application on a mobile phone, server, etc.). In this documentation a host is a logical network application. A physical piece of hardware could possibly have multiple hosts running on it as long as each of them can be independently addressed.

**Downstream**: A downstream host connects to Envoy, sends requests, and receives responses.

**Upstream**: An upstream host receives connections and requests from Envoy and returns responses.
